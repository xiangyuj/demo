# Introduction
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Statatis Analysis for data car
```{r, cache=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Plot
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center',fig.width=10,fig.height=7}
plot(cars)
```

## Histogram
```{r}
h <- hist(cars$speed,xlab="speed",ylab="frequency",main="Histogram of Speed",ylim=c(0,20))
xfit <- seq(min(cars$speed),max(cars$speed),length=50)
yfit <- dnorm(xfit, mean=mean(cars$speed),sd=sd(cars$speed))
yfit <- yfit*diff(h$mids[1:2])*length(cars$speed)
lines(xfit, yfit, col="blue",lwd=2)
hist(cars$dist,xlab="distance",ylab="frequency",main="Histogram of Distance")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
